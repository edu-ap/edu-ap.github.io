<!-- Directorease – basic call script 

To effectively prepare for the Chambers submission, it's crucial to gather comprehensive and precise information from the senior lawyer tasked with responsibility for the submission. The following interview script is designed to elicit all necessary details within a 45-minute meeting. 

Intro  

Thank you for meeting with me. Our objective today is to gather all the necessary information to complete our Chambers submission accurately and comprehensively. 

A. Preliminary information 

No discussion required. This information will have been pre-populated from previous submissions. 

B. Department information 

Numbers: Can I just confirm the numbers we have in relation to people within the department? We’ve taken last year’s numbers as a baseline? Do you want us to update / check with HR? 

Leavers/joiners: Have there been any significant changes in the team over the past year, such as notable hires or departures?" 

[Edu note – we should be able to scrape the corporate website for joiners. Simple search on Twobirds website provides this example] 

Ranked/unranked lawyers: we’ve pulled across the list of ranked/unranked lawyers from last year’s submission doc and removed anyone that’s left and/or upgraded anyone that’s been promoted. Are there any omissions / people you want to add? 

[Edu note – again, the majority of this info will come from last year’s submission doc and be largely similar. Things we could do to enhance is scrape the website for each individual and identify if they are mentioned on any new deals / have written new articles / participated in events / webinars etc] 

What is the department best known for: we’ve pulled across the description from last year’s submission so have a good baseplate for the information and description. Can you tell me though, in your own words, what you think we should highlight this year? Things that resonate with the directories include: 

Market making deals 

“First of” type transactions 

Big lateral hires 

Big new client wins 

Feedback: do you have any feedback on the ranking we received last year? 

[Edu note – what would be helpful here is to identify:  

what was last years ranking 

who was ranked above/below/same tier 

what was the commentary associated with the firm] 

Are there any firms in particular that have done well / poorly in the previous 12 months that we want to highlight to the directories? Examples would include where a big hitting lateral / team has left one firm and joined another and/or whether a firm has not been visible on transactions / matters. Similarly, if one firm has dominated the deal size / volume – we should mention them. 

[Edu] 

C. Feedback 

Has the team worked with any barristers or advocates over the past 12 months that are worthy of note and inclusion in the submission? If so, who? Can you tell me a little bit about why you’d recommend them? 

[Edu note – it is likely that the list from the previous year’s submission will not have changed materially and so I would drag this across as part of the pre work] 

D. Publishable information & E. Confidential Information 

[Edu note – the question set for publishable and non publishable matters is the same. This section is where I think we can make most difference during the submission process.] 

So, we’re going to spend the next portion of the interview talking about the matters that will make the submission stand out.  

As you know, there are two types of matter for Chambers – publishable and non-publishable (i.e. confidential).  

First of all, let’s look at the matters that were categorised as ongoing last year and might still be viable for inclusion this year. Remember, a matter can be included if there is a material change in the status of the matter during the previous 12 months. 

[Edu note – list ongoing matters from previous submission. Decide whether each matter should be included.] 

We’ve also identified, from a variety of sources (pitches, website etc) the following potential matters for inclusion. 

[Edu note – list ongoing matters from previous submission. Decide whether each matter should be included.] 

First of all, let’s run through those matters we’re going to include again from last year’s submission. We need to know, for each one, the updates you can provide on matter progress. This could be that the matter has reached a significant milestone (has closed / transaction has completed) for example.  

 

For new matters we are including this year we need to run through the requirements that need to be flagged as part of the Chambers submission. This will ensure that the researcher has all of the relevant information required to decide on your ranking.  

Firstly, who was the client? And is this deal publishable or confidential? To clarify, publishable means that Chambers can use the client’s name in their rankings commentary and associate the client/matter with you. 

Tell me, in your own words, what was the matter and what we did for them. if useful, think about answering the question in three parts: 

Why did the client come to you? What problem were they trying to solve? Why was the engagement of you (external counsel) important to them? 

What did you do to help the client solve their problem? What steps did you take?  

What was the outcome of the matter? What value did the client gain from engaging you / your firm? Was the value reputational / monetary / risk avoidance / growth?  

[Edu note – at this point it would be useful to check notes and see if any of the following questions (hygiene factors) have already been included. If not, ask the questions below] 

Thanks for that description. A few follow up questions if I may to ensure we have a complete dataset when it comes to drafting: 

Is there a value we can place on the matter? This can be the transactional value of the deal or size of claim. 

Is the matter cross border? If so, can you list the jurisdictions you acted in and the lawyers in those jurisdictions? 

Who led the matter on your side? Are there other team members we should mention in addition to those you’ve listed from other jurisdictions above? 

Has the matter completed? If so, when did it finish? If not, we’ll list as “ongoing”. OK? 

Is there anything else you think would be useful to add about the matter? Was there any press coverage? Did we win any awards? 

[@Edu note – this last question set is then repeated for each new matter that the lead lawyer wants to put forward.]
